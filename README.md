# Hands-on-NLP-with-PyTorch
Collection of Notebooks for Natural Language Processing with PyTorch


This notebook contains all the code for the [course](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-natural-language-processing-pytorch-video) that I did for PacktPub.<br />

The sections are divided by folders. <br />

<b>The topics that are covered are:</b> <br /><br /><br />
1.[UP AND RUNNING WITH PYTORCH](https://github.com/jibinmathew691993/Hands-on-NLP-with-PyTorch/tree/master/section1)<br />
In   this   section,   you   setup   our   environment   for   PyTorch   and   learn   to   perform   some   basic   operations   with  PyTorch   and   build   quick   Neural   network   with   PyTorch   and   also   understand   why   Deep   Learning   is   a   useful  technique for NLP. <br /><br/>
2.[DATA CLEANING AND PREPROCESSING FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS](https://github.com/jibinmathew691993/Hands-on-NLP-with-PyTorch/tree/master/section2)<br />
 In this section, you will learn the use of tools like NLTK and Spacy as NLP libraries and how they help in data preprocessing. You will clean your data with NLTK then parse and lemmatize the data with Spacy and understand pipelines.<br /><br/>
3.[IMPLEMENT WORD EMBEDDINGS WITH GENSIM](https://github.com/jibinmathew691993/Hands-on-NLP-with-PyTorch/tree/master/section3)<br />
 In this section, you will discover the conceptual relationship in a text and how they help in overall
understanding Text. You will perform hands on operations with Gensim library.<br /><br/>
4.[TRAIN RNNS AND LSTMS UNITS FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS](https://github.com/jibinmathew691993/Hands-on-NLP-with-PyTorch/tree/master/section4)<br />
In this section, you will deep dive into Deep Learning and implement RNNs for our Sentiment Analysis, and further improve the performance with advanced architectures and LSTM.<br /><br/>
5.[BUILD A NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATOR](https://github.com/jibinmathew691993/Hands-on-NLP-with-PyTorch/tree/master/section5)<br />
In this section, you will learn an important Deep Learning architecture within NLP called
Sequence-to-sequence and learn to appreciate its applications and complete our project to build a Neural
Translation Machine.<br /><br/>
6.[IMPROVE THE NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION WITH ATTENTION NETWORKS](https://github.com/jibinmathew691993/Hands-on-NLP-with-PyTorch/tree/master/section5)<br />
In this section, you will deep dive into Deep Learning and implement RNNs for our Sentiment Analysis, and further improve the performance with advanced architectures and LSTM.
